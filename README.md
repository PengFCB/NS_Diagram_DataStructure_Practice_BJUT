# NS_Diagram_DataStructure_Practice_BJUT
2018 BJUT Data Structure practice project, a java application used to draw simple Nassi–Shneiderman diagram.

## Introduction
The data structure asked students to acommplish an application which can help people draw a NS diagram with an object oriented language. According to the teaching plan, using data structure functions provided by the language (e.g. STL in C++) is prohibited. Students need to design their own class to help them finish the whole project.

In my project, a tree-like structure has been used in the application. The appliction support Process blocks, Test First blocks, Test last blocks and True/False Branching blocks. In addition, user can save their diagram as a C style txt， which can help with their programming.

## Development Environment
OS: MacOS

IDE: NetBeans

JDK Vesrsion: 8
