# NS_Graph_DataStructure_Practice_BJUT
2018 BJUT Data Structure practice project, a java application used to draw simple NS graph.

## Introduction
The data structure asked students to acommplish an application which can help people draw a NS graph with an object oriented language. According to the teaching plan, using data structure fction provided by the language (e.g. STL in C++) is prohibited. Students need to design their own class to help them finish the whole project.

In my project, a tree-like structure has been used in the application. The appliction support sequence structure, Do While structure , Do Until structure and judging (True or False) structure. In addition, user can save their NS graph as a C style txtï¼Œ which can help with their programming.

## Development Environment
